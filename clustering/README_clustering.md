These are all the files and documents related to clustering that are created by the code (although in the same directory as the data set).

"cluster_results" are the breakdowns of each cluster's contents by set

"complete_linkage" are the dendrograms for the clustered sets.

"method_comp" is a cluster number vs threshold plot for average, complete, single, and ward linakges, by set.
