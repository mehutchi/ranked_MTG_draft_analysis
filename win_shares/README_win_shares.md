These are all the files and documents related to win shares that are created by the code (although when running the code they appear in the same directory as the data set).

for each MTG set:

a suffix "all" indicates cards of all rarities

a suffix "common" indicates only common cards

a suffix "uncommon" indicates only uncommon cards

Cards with winshares under 50% of the average are excluded (from any plot) unless they have a number of copies/inclusions greater than 50% of the maximum copies/inclusions.
